# beelieve_in_ourselves

## Introduction
As part of the study project of the EI2I speciality of Polytech Sorbonne, in which we are students in the fourth year, we have developed the Open Hive project. This project spanned the entire first half of the year and totalled 60 hours of framed time. We were supervised by M. Yann DOUZE and M. Sylvain VIATEUR.

The goal of the project is to develop a device that can obtain phyisical measurements and make them available through an user interface over a web application.

This project is able to get values from the sensors, formatting the data and send it over a Cloud server thanks to Sigfox, a long-range and low power technology (LPWAN).
