# beelieve_in_ourselves

## Introduction
As part of the study project of the EI2I speciality of Polytech Sorbonne, in which we are students in the fourth year, we have developed the Open Hive project. This project spanned the entire first half of the year and totalled 60 hours of framed time. We were supervised by M. Yann DOUZE and M. Sylvain VIATEUR.

The goal of the project is to develop a device that can obtain phyisical measurements and make them available through an user interface over a web application.

This project is able to get values from the sensors, formatting the data and send it over a Cloud platform thanks to Sigfox, a long-range and low power technology (LPWAN).

## Subject Presentation
The goal of this project is to create a connected box equipped with sensors that send the data to a cloud platform. 

The case and the hive is be equipped with intelligent sensors for provide data on bee health and productivity.\
Data are graphically accessible from a web interface on PC Desktop. \
The system is also be able to send alerts to your smartphone by mail when abnormal behaviour is detected such .

Functional analysis is an approach that involves researching and characterizing the functions offered by a product to meet the needs of its user.

The approach is generally conducted in project mode and can be used to create (design) or improve (redesign) a product.
Here the Bete a corne diagram that we made for our project.
